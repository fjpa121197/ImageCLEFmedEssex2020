The file "fine_tunning.py" creates the trained models based on images for each modality. This file uses a DenseNet-121 model,
and then it is fine-tuned based on the tags for each image.  

The file "extract_features.py" uses the models generated to extract the features for each image based on the type of modality.  
The folder "models" is where the models are saved and can be used for future purposes (extract features)
